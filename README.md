# ReactJS initial study

 This is a program made to understand the main functionalities of ReactJS and how the features work. The main files are the index.html and script.js. In these files, i implement a React app. The file script.js file has the code in JSX format, and scriptBeforeJSX.js have the implementation without JSX, using the React.createElement and React.createContext functions. 

 In the end, the JSX in the file script.js was compiled with babel to a language that the browser can understand. That is why babelTranspiled.js is included in the index.html and not the script.js.
